(KNN), xgboosting classifier,logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier,
● Description: Perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews to determine if the
sentiment is positive or negative.
TASK 6
MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
● Build a simple movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering
techniques.
● Use a dataset of user ratings for movies to create a model that can recommend
movies to users based on their preferences and behavior.
TASK 7
DIGIT RECOGNIZER
● Build a digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28
pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
● Train a neural network (e.g., a simple feedforward network or a convolutional neural
network) to classify the images into their respective digits.
TASK 8
EMOJI PREDICTION
● Create a model that can predict appropriate emojis based on text input.
● Use a dataset of text messages or social media posts with associated emojis to
train a model that can suggest emojis based on the content of the text.
